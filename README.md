**footypredictor**

A microservice which will utilise my Football Prediction Machine Learning app to generate football predictions for upcoming matches.

**footypredictor UI**

The UI component lives within the footypredictor project under `/app`
This will be separated in the future, but for now the server and client code lives together in the same project. They are completely decoupled, just not from a repository perspective.

The UI is built utilising the React framework.
See `/app/README.md` for further details.
